# A Python class that verify function calls

This repository is a debug aid for complex Python software.
It lets you record a reference run and later find the deviation from the correct run.
This might be useful, for example, when you port a software from Python2 to Python3. Or when you added some C functions, that replace existing Python code. Or refactored software.
